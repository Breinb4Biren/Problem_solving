✅ Explanation

🔁 Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare)

We use two pointers, one moving slowly (1 step) and the other fast (2 steps).

If a cycle exists, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer inside the cycle.

If the fast pointer reaches the end (null), there's no cycle.

🔍 Step-by-Step:

Initialize two pointers: slow = head, fast = head

Traverse the list:

Move slow by 1 step.

Move fast by 2 steps.

If at any point slow == fast, we found a cycle → return true

If fast or fast.next is null, return false


📦 Real World Applications

1. Dependency Management (e.g., npm, Maven, pip)

Detecting circular dependencies in packages — if A depends on B, and B depends on A, it forms a cycle.

2. Memory Management & Garbage Collection

Some objects reference each other — forming cycles. Languages like Java use cycle detection to free memory that would otherwise stay occupied.

3. Web Redirects and Crawlers

Web pages that redirect in loops (A → B → C → A). Crawlers use cycle detection to avoid infinite crawling.

4. Workflow/Task Scheduling Systems

Cycle detection prevents infinite loops in task dependencies (e.g., Task A depends on B which depends on A).

5. OS or Low-Level Data Structures

File systems or schedulers using linked structures must ensure that pointers don’t accidentally form cycles (due to bugs).
